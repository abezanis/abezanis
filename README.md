- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @abezanis
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data Science, my career goals are to puruse somthing regarding analytics or computer science. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently getting my undergrad! I am learning ML and have been working on a lot of hypothesis testing.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have always had a big passion for statistics (since freshman year of highschool) and throughout my college time I have really enjoy coding projects.
- I have learned many coding languages including: python, R, c/c++, SQL, Java, Clsip, and Prolog. Learing a new coding language has always been a fun time!
